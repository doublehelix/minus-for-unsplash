Instanon is a small browser extension that allows you to browse Instagram without being logged in. It gets rid of the annoying popup that forces you to log in and makes it possible to navigate on Instagram accounts. You can see it in action [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qclh3RRlRo8).

Instanon was available [for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/instanon-%C2%B7%C2%A0browse-instagr/jddbknhpoofgengmimpglapgcfapimdg).

## Features

* Blocks Instagram login popups 

## Current state

❗️ As of may 2021, the functionality of Instanon has been severely limited. Since the plugin's conception, Instagram has implemented some server-side changes to their website which make it impossible to browse while being logged out. The plugin technically still works, but after a few photo requests, Instagram will redirect you to its login page. Also, Facebook took it down from the Chrome Web Store. ❗️
