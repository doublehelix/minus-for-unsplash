Unsplash Minus is a small browser extension that allows you to hide all [Unsplash+](https://unsplash.com/plus) content from the Unsplash website. It gets rid of all the Unsplash+ photos in your grid as well as the Unsplash+ link in the header. You can see it in action [here]().

Unsplash Minus is available for [Firefox]() and [Chrome]().

<!-- Current state

❗️ As of may 2021, the functionality of Instanon has been severely limited. Since the plugin's conception, Instagram has implemented some server-side changes to their website which make it impossible to browse while being logged out. The plugin technically still works, but after a few photo requests, Instagram will redirect you to its login page. Also, Facebook took it down from the Chrome Web Store. ❗️
